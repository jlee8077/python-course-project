# This program will allow a user to find the mass of a chemical substance (in grams), the amount of moles
#   of a chemical substance (in moles), the number of molecules of a chemical substance, and the Molarity
#   of a chemical substance (in moles per Liter).
#   The program will have a main function that will allow the user to input what he/she wants to do.
#   Then the main function will call the corresponding function depending on the choice.  Once the
#   called function makes the calculation and returns a value, the main function
#   will go through a while loop to determine if the user wants to continue.
#
#   Local variables include the following:
#       'volume' is the volume of the chemical substance in Liters
#       'mass' is the mass of a substance in grams
#       'mole' is the mole amount of a substance
#       'molecularWeight' is the amount of mass (in grams) per mole of a substance
#       'density' is the weight of a substance per volume in mL
#       'Molarity' is the conversion factor of moles per volume in Liters
